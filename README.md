We've spent years perfecting hybrid mobile app functionality, which many refer to as PWAs (ie. progressive web apps) or HTML5 Apps - and we've combined all the best technology we've figured out or learned thanks to others brilliant work. There are tons of headaches involving PWAs because both Apple (Mobile Safari) and Google (Mobile Chrome) are constantly changing things with their mobile browsers - and web app functionality is clearly far from their priorities.

Basically, you can grab the files and drop the folder into any website (just make sure you correctly reference/link to the support files).

A few important notes: 
- The specific choices we nade with the META tags are VERY important to the full-screen experience - especially with phones that have the infamous "notch".
- The stay stand alone file is super important to keeping the user IN your "web" app. Without this, when users click on a link or linked button they'll simply bounce outside of the app back into whatever their default mobile browser is - which totally destroys the app-like experience.
- The overlay that we added (that tells users how to add the App Icon) has been our signature for more than a decade and has always been extremely helpful with instantly teaching users that a website has these "app" like capabilities. But, it is optional and can easily be removed.
- We also left in some DOM code that helps surgically target different devices based on screen size (ie width), which is super helpful with perfectly adapting existing layout elements like Nav Bars with the Web App version and these targets can basically help you "adjust" every single pixel of your design, layout, buttons, css, graphics, etc. to any existing website or rather, mobile website - to be perfectly aligned and optimized for your Web App version.
